"""
Picross 3D solver by Emily Johnston
with some help from David Johnston and Charlotte Foran
for Andy Exley's Artificial Intelligence class, Carleton College, Spring 2014

Utilizes SATSolver.py and zChaff to solve Picross 3D puzzles using propositional logic.
Displays 3D solution using VPython.

Does not support puzzles with multiple grouping (circle or square numbers).
